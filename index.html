                a curious individual who is noisy and googling my name you are in the right place. This is the perfect place where you can keep up on Ben
                without talking to Ben (weird but I can't stop it). Here you can visit the Timeline where you can go and learn about Ben's upgringing or perhaps your more interested in
                Ben currently which leads us to the Blog. The truth is the best way to learn this site is to click around and see where it takes you, who knows you might learn something new.</span>
                Hello! My name is Benjamin and if you would believe it this inst my first website. I made this site so that
                people can keep tabs on me without talking to me or texting to me. This isnt because I dont like talking to people but I wanted to optimize my workflow and to do that this website
                just makes sense.
