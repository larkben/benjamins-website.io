                <h3 id='text'> Why does this site exist? <br></h3>
                <p id='subtext'> Part of the reason this site exists is to serve as a place for 
                    my future employers to see my work and my skills in the tech space. The other part is that I didn't feel
                    that enough individuals knew enough about me or were scared to ask about me so this site acts as a hub.
                    Social media links and much more to serve as a perfect place to both network or connect with me without having
                    to talk to in person <i>(I do appreciate a good talk though)</i>.

                <h3 id='text'> A little bit about myself? </h3>
                <p id='subtext'> Obviously my name is Benjamin but I go by Ben. People have called me a big flexer which I 
                    probably am and do talk about my success but equally about others achievements as well. I have never
                    been employed anywhere as of writing this besides my side hustles (mowing yards and home work). Oddly
                    enough I have no interest in building houses but very high interest in learning about computers and further
                    increasing my knowledge to that of even beyond and expert. I have a very high motivational drive to succeed.
